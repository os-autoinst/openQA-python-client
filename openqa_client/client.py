    """This is a job de-duping function. There is some ambiguity
    about exactly what jobs are 'duplicates' in openQA, as it's
    developed somewhat organically and it's not clear what is
    convention, what is policy, what is technical limitation etc.
    It would probably be useful if openQA itself provided more
    capabilities here.

    openQA has some code that does approximately the same thing,
    backing the per-build 'Overview' you can get in the web UI.
    As I write this it lives in
    lib/OpenQA/WebAPI/Controller/Test.pm and is not externally
    usable. It uses a 'key' made up of TEST setting, FLAVOR
    setting, ARCH setting, and MACHINE setting. The overview is
    for a specific combination of DISTRI, VERSION and BUILD.
    We're going to reproduce that logic here.

    Passed a list of job dicts, this will return a list containing
    only the newest job for each key - it will filter out earlier
    runs of 'the same' test for each distri/version/build included
    in the list.
